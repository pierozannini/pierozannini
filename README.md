- 👋 Hi, I’m @pierozannini
- 👀 I’m interested in macroecology, conservation biology, island biogeography, ecoinformatics, data analysis, web development and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git/GitHub, JavaScript, PHP, HTML and CSS, while delving into Shiny (R) and package development (R).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OSS and research projects (ecology and conservation biology sensu lato).
- 📫 How to reach me: piero.zannini2@unibo.it
